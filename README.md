# Neutron-Density
A program that takes in values for reactivty and outputs the neutrion density at given time intervals.

The file main.f90 acts as the main program file that will handle the input and pass it to the subroutine neuden() 
neutrondens.f90. I have provided two example output files labeled ct.out and nt.out. The first column of ct.out gives the time and the following six column represent the precursor concentration at each time step. The first column of nt.out also gives the time and the second column gives the neutron density at that time step.
